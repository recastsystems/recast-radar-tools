//! International (non-NEXRAD) radar feed provider scaffolding.
//!
//! BowEcho's decode layer is already source-agnostic: `recast_radar_io`'s shared
//! magic-byte router decodes ODIM_H5 polar volumes (EUMETNET OPERA Data
//! Information Model; Michelson et al., OPERA WP 2.1/2.2, v2.2-2.3),
//! CfRadial 1.x classic netCDF, DORADE sweepfiles, and NEXRAD Archive II
//! from plain byte buffers. What national feeds differ in is *cataloging*:
//! how to list sites and how to name the newest frame. This module defines
//! that catalog contract so each provider (DMI Denmark, SMHI Sweden,
//! GeoSphere Austria, FMI Finland, SHMU Slovakia, DWD Germany, CHMI Czechia,
//! KNMI Netherlands, JMA Japan via polar-coordinate GRIB2 per the JMA
//! technical format documentation, ...) is a small adapter, not a fork of
//! the polling pipeline.
//!
//! # Consumer pipeline
//!
//! A poller drives a provider like this:
//!
//! 1. `IntlProvider::list_sites` populates the site picker.
//! 2. On each poll tick, `IntlProvider::latest` returns a [`FramePlan`].
//! 3. If [`FramePlan::identity`] equals the identity of the frame already
//!    installed, the poller does nothing — no part is downloaded.
//! 4. Otherwise every [`PlanPart::url`] is fetched with
//!    `crate::fetch_volume_bytes` and decoded with
//!    `recast_radar_io::read_supported_volume_bytes`; multi-part plans with
//!    [`FramePlan::merge`] set are then assembled with
//!    `recast_radar_core::model::merge_volumes`.
//!
//! Providers therefore never download data themselves: `latest` does the
//! (cheap) catalog probe — via `crate::fetch_text` or an equivalent
//! listing helper — and describes the download; the shared poller owns
//! bytes, retries, decode, and merge.
//!
//! One provider-specific decode exception: JMA tars are multi-station
//! archives, and `recast_radar_io::read_supported_volume_bytes` decodes only
//! the FIRST station of such a tar. The poll consumer must therefore pass
//! the selected site as a `site_filter` to
//! `recast_radar_io_jma::decode_jma_tar_volumes` when the plan came from
//! [`JmaProvider`] (see its docs).
